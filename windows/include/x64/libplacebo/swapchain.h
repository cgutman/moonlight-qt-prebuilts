// setting the swapchain size to the values requested by the user, and returns
// in the same variables what width/height the swapchain was actually set to -
// which may be (substantially) different from the values requested by the
// user. A value of 0 means "unknown/none" (in which case, libplacebo won't try
// updating the size - it will simply return the current state of the
// swapchain). It's also possible for libplacebo to return values of 0, such as
// in the case that the swapchain doesn't exist yet.

// asynchronously. Users must still base their rendering on the value of
// `pl_swapchain_frame.color_space`.
//
// Note: Calling this function a second time completely overrides any
// previously specified hint. So calling this on {0} or NULL resets the
// swapchain back to its initial/preferred colorspace.

// Note: If `csp->transfer` is a HDR transfer curve but HDR metadata is left
// unspecified, the HDR metadata defaults to `pl_hdr_metadata_hdr10`.

// PL_COLOR_TRC_UNKNOWN, then it instead defaults to PL_COLOR_TRC_PQ.

// rendering frames significantly faster than the display can output them. It
// may also be non-blocking, so users shouldn't rely on this call alone in
// order to meter rendering speed. (Specifics depend on the underlying graphics
// API)

// generally be made visible in a first-in first-out fashion, although
// specifics depend on the mechanism used to create the pl_swapchain. (See the
// platform-specific APIs for more info).
//
// Returns whether successful. This should normally never fail, unless the
// GPU/surface has been lost or some other critical error has occurred. The
// "started" frame is consumed even in the event of failure.
//
// Note that `start_frame` and `submit_frame` form a lock pair, i.e. trying to
// call e.g. `pl_swapchain_resize` from another thread will block until
// `pl_swapchain_submit_frame` is finished.
PL_API bool pl_swapchain_submit_frame(pl_swapchain sw);

// Performs a "buffer swap", or some generalization of the concept. In layman's
// terms, this blocks until the execution of the Nth previously submitted frame
// has been "made complete" in some sense. (The N derives from the swapchain's
// built-in latency. See `pl_swapchain_latency` for more information).
//
// Users should include this call in their rendering loops in order to make
// sure they aren't submitting rendering commands faster than the GPU can
// process them, which would potentially lead to a queue overrun or exhaust
// memory.

//
//     while (rendering) {
//         struct pl_swapchain_frame frame;
//         bool ok = pl_swapchain_start_frame(swapchain, &frame);

//         pl_swapchain_swap_buffers(swapchain);
//     }
//
// The duration this function blocks for, if at all, may be very inconsistent
// and should not be used as an authoritative source of vsync timing
// information without sufficient smoothing/filtering (and if so, the time that
// `start_frame` blocked for should also be included).
