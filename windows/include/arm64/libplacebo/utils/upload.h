// This file contains a utility function to assist in uploading data from host
// memory to a texture. In particular, the texture will be suitable for use as
// a `pl_plane`.

struct pl_plane_data {
    enum pl_fmt_type type;  // meaning of the data (must not be UINT or SINT)
    int width, height;      // dimensions of the plane
    int component_size[4];  // size in bits of each coordinate
    int component_pad[4];   // ignored bits preceding each component
    int component_map[4];   // semantic meaning of each component (pixel order)
    size_t pixel_stride;    // offset in bytes between pixels (required)
    size_t row_stride;      // offset in bytes between rows (optional)
    bool swapped;           // pixel data is endian-swapped (non-native)

    // Similar to `pl_tex_transfer_params`, you can either upload from a raw
    // pointer address, or a buffer + offset. Again, the use of these two
    // mechanisms is mutually exclusive.
    //
    // 1. Uploading from host memory

    // 2. Uploading from a buffer (requires `pl_gpu_limits.buf_transfer`)

    size_t buf_offset;      // offset of data within buffer, must be a
                            // multiple of `pixel_stride` as well as of 4

    // Similar to `pl_tex_transfer_params.callback`, this allows turning the
    // upload of a plane into an asynchronous upload. The same notes apply.

    void *priv;

    // Note: When using this together with `pl_frame`, there is some amount of
    // overlap between `component_pad` and `pl_color_repr.bits`. Some key
    // differences between the two:
    //
    // - the bits from `component_pad` are ignored; whereas the superfluous bits
    //   in a `pl_color_repr` must be 0.
    // - the `component_pad` exists to align the component size and placement
    //   with the capabilities of GPUs; the `pl_color_repr` exists to control
    //   the semantics of the color samples on a finer granularity.
    // - the `pl_color_repr` applies to the color sample as a whole, and
    //   therefore applies to all planes; the `component_pad` can be different
    //   for each plane.
    // - `component_pad` interacts with float textures by moving the actual
    //   float in memory. `pl_color_repr` interacts with float data as if
    //   the float was converted from an integer under full range semantics.
    //
    // To help establish the motivating difference, a typical example of a use
    // case would be yuv420p10. Since 10-bit GPU texture support is limited,
    // and working with non-byte-aligned pixels is awkward in general, the
    // convention is to represent yuv420p10 as 16-bit samples with either the
    // high or low bits set to 0. In this scenario, the `component_size` of the
    // `pl_plane_data` and `pl_bit_encoding.sample_depth` would be 16, while
    // the `pl_bit_encoding.color_depth` would be 10 (and additionally, the
    // `pl_bit_encoding.bit_shift` would be either 0 or  6, depending on
    // whether the low or the high bits are used).
    //
    // On the contrary, something like a packed, 8-bit XBGR format (where the
    // X bits are ignored and may contain garbage) would set `component_pad[0]`
    // to 8, and the component_size[0:2] (respectively) to 8 as well.
    //
    // As a general rule of thumb, for maximum compatibility, you should try
    // and align component_size/component_pad to multiples of 8 and explicitly
    // clear any remaining superfluous bits (+ use `pl_color_repr.bits` to
    // ensure they're decoded correctly). You should also try to align the
    // `pixel_stride` to a power of two.

// based on the supplied mask for each component (in semantic order, i.e.
// RGBA). Each element of `mask` must have a contiguous range of set bits.
